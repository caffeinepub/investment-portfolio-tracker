# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add sidebar icons for Aadhaar and PAN card entry with inline input fields and automatic holdings fetch functionality.

**Planned changes:**
- Add two distinct icons to the sidebar: one for Aadhaar card entry and one for PAN card entry
- Display inline input fields in the sidebar when each icon is clicked
- Implement automatic fetching of investment holdings when valid Aadhaar and PAN numbers are entered
- Add a manual fetch button to trigger holdings retrieval on demand

**User-visible outcome:** Users can click dedicated Aadhaar and PAN icons in the sidebar to enter their card numbers inline, and the system will automatically fetch and display all linked investment holdings immediately, with an option to manually trigger the fetch.
