However, the automatic fetching mechanism on valid entry (REQ-3) is not clearly evident in the truncated diff, and the required icon image files are missing from the implementation.",

      "reason": "The diff shows manual fetch functionality via useFetchSoaHoldings hook and buttons, but does not show automatic triggering when both valid Aadhaar and PAN numbers are entered. No useEffect or similar auto-trigger logic is visible in the truncated frontend/src/App.tsx",
